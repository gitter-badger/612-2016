/*This command gets two axis inputs from the left and right y-axis of the driver controller in OI, 
then adds a dead-zone (if axis value is within 0.1 of 0, make it 0). 
Finally, it sends this value to the SetTankDrive method of the drivetrain subsystem.
When it ends, or is interrupted, set SetTankDrive to 0, 0 to stop the robot. 
Also add a check using the Joystick::GetIsXbox method to change the y value axis 
if the controller is a joystick vs an xbox gamepad. */

/*the way the drive system works, there should be a dead zone on both axes individually. 
(i.e. if axis one is 0.08 and axis two is 0.6, then the output to the motors should be 0 and 0.6, not 0 and 0).
Finally, when i refer to Joystick, i am talking about the Joystick class which can be found here: 
http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/cpp/classJoystick.html 
SetTankDrive, SetArcadeDrive, and SetManualDrive are all methods that will be put in the Drivetrain subststem file. 
They will be called from commands. Commands are called in a few different ways. 
They can be called automatically by a button press, they can be called by a command group, 
or they can be called manually by calling the Command's Start() method. M
ore info on how this works can be found here:
